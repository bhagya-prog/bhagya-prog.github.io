            <div class="blog">
                <p>In this first session, we learnt Git and Github. We learnt how to fork, push, pull and many more
                    stuff. We also got some customized banners from our seniors. They made learning so easy and
                    interesting. They were always there whenever there was an issue. We also created our GitHub accounts
                    and also pushed a few files to understand the process.</p>

            <h2>First Meetup: GirlUp Society</h2>
            <div class="blog">
                <p>GirlUp is not only a society which work towards betterment of only girls, but it's main agenda is
                    gender equality, mental health and also helping others. Not much boys join this society, and the
                    reason is obvious, its name. People have a mentality that GirlUp is just about girls. But, I joined
                    it and I will for sure change the mentality. MY MAIN MOTIVE IS TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S THINKING FOR EVERY
                    GENDER AND ALSO MAKE THIS WORLD A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, GirlUp is that society which will give me the
                    chance to do so.

            <div class="blog">
                <p>Backslash Computing Society is not only a tech society but more than that. When I saw their intro, I
                    was stunned and wanted to join this society only. And now I am here as a psrt of tech team. I joined
                    with just a few knowledge of coding, but will for sure leave with a lot of knowledge and
                    experiences.
                    I will remember this first meetup forever... START OF A NEW JOURNEY.
