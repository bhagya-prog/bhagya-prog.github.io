            <p>I am a coder who loves coding and also in real world loves nature. In my personal blog, I have added a
                bit of projects that I have worked on
                and also a bit of pictures of nature that I have clicked. </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Myself, Bhagya, a normal person with ambitions of high level. I come from Jalandhar, Punjab. I did my
                schooling from Innocent Hearts School. I scored 94.2% in 10th and 92.4% in 12th (CBSE).
                I started my coding journey from class 11th mainly. I first learnt Python and MySQL. Though I first
                thought I would just learn them as subjects,
                but with time my interest in coding increased. I loved the concept of coding with which only a few lines
                of code can do miracles. I also learnt
                web development, only the front-end part to be precise.I am currently learning C language for my college
                as well as my personal use.
                I am currently a first year undergraduate at <b>THAPAR UNIVERSITY OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY</b> pursuing my
                degree in Computer Science and
                Engineering. I am currently in 3 societies: <i>BACKSLASH COMPUTING SOCIETY, Mudra, GirlUp</i>... I am planning
                to become the best version of
                myself after my 1st year. </p>

            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project 1:</strong>
                    Inventory management (PYTHON + CSV)
                    <p>In this project, I created two different sections : Boss interface and Employee Interface. In
                        this project, I used matplotlib library,
                        function definitions and more to connect everything and make an awesome project in PYTHON using
                        CSV file.</p>
                </li>
                <a class="anchor" href="code.py">PYTHON CODE</a> <br>
                <a class="anchor" href="inventory.csv">CSV FILE</a>
                <li><strong>Project 2:</strong> PERSONAL BLOG WEBSITE : The website that you are currently using is one
                    of my projects. It was given
                    by BACKSLASH COMPUTING SOCIETY as a project work. I have made this website responsive as much as I
                    can. This is one of my favourite
                    projects because I created it from scratch without any help. </li>
                <li>I have also created many other smaller projects like clones of websites (Amazon etc.) and also
                    created small projects in PYTHON language.
                </li>
            </ul>
